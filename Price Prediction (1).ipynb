    "You can change the model to another and [this page](https://gluon-nlp.mxnet.io/model_zoo/bert/index.html) has parameters for that. Additionally you can change the dataset to a different one. The model I loaded outputs an embedding in the shape of 768, as it can be seen in the name of model. Bigger number will generate bigger features which might boost accuracy of the model so feel free to try different models as well."
